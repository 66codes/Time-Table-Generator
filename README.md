#Introduction-
>This is the mini project that I have done in my 3rd year. Its intended to generate time tables for our department. I have developed web interface to insert and retrieve information they are done using PHP. And the Algorithm was written in Java. Genetic Algorithm has been used for the scheduling/contesting process.

#Deployment
*Just deploy like any other web project. 
* All files except .sql file should go to the context root.
* .sql should imported then(tt_gen). 
* Sometimes db connection properties should configured accoriding to.
*Java should deployed in NetBeans. In my documents into NetBeans Projecs folder.
* username *admin* password *knights*.

##Issues
* Still have some issues with the genetic Algorihtm. I'm working on it. Anyone interested can contribute :) 
* Adding subjects is another issue.  It will add but conflicts with the loops that  I have written.

anyone who is in need may use it. refer it. I'm fine with it. Thank you.
